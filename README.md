# Voting_System
Created a responsive voting web app for a school using React.js, HTML, and CSS, hosted online with Firebase for data storage. It ensures single votes by removing buttons after selection and shows a 10-second "Thank You" message before resetting. A notification system confirms votes to students immediately after casting.
